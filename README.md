# Financial-API
This project consists of an API to be used for opening a new ‚Äúcurrent account‚Äù of already existing
customers.

### Requirements
‚Ä¢ The API will expose an endpoint which accepts the user information (customerID, initialCredit).
‚Ä¢ Once the endpoint is called, a new account will be opened connected to the user whose ID is
customerID.
‚Ä¢ Also, if initialCredit is not 0, a transaction will be sent to the new account.
‚Ä¢ Another Endpoint will output the user information showing Name, Surname,
balance, and transactions of the accounts.

### Bonuses
‚Ä¢ Accounts and Transactions are different services.
‚Ä¢ Frontend (simple one is OK).
‚Ä¢ Attention to CI/CD
